When configuring kernel, make sure to enable in framebuffer-devices efi based framebuffer so that you can access the terminal
make sure to configure amdgpu and filesystems
disable intel things you don't need
set optimization level to O3

You can sync the gentoobr repository with "emaint sync -r gentoobr", and vice versa for all portage overlays
-j16 seems to work fine and not run out of memory at all, use that
maybe experiment with the LTO overlay next time

use man portage and scroll all the way down to get to configuration merging, beware what you do in that regard

to unmask a package use --autounmask=y --autounmask-write and then use dispatch-conf to update the portage config files
this way you can install things like xanmod-sources
