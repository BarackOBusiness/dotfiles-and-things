# Some instructions for future me

## Things to install

Ok you know what you got this, you don't need instructions\
This completely destroys the above statement but uhh here's the game plan:\
Install void\
Install micro, opendoas, fish-shell, and 66 - should be done pretty easily\
DESTROY SUDO (and runit (but don't remove it))\
(Make your core+tty+graphical tree setup as usual, follow the manual instructions)\
Install dbus elogind variants and elogind and libseat obviously\
reboot with those services enabled

## Phase 2

Install sway, all the shit in the amd or ati section of the voidlinux handbook\
\+ ffmpeg + kitty + firefox + rofi + something I'm probably forgetting\
verify sway works, then go BALLS TO THE WALLS with this config\
(install [wlgreet](https://git.sr.ht/~kennylevinsen/wlgreet) (you know the deal))\
(((get pipewire working, DOWNLOAD THE WHOLE MUSIC PLAYLIST AND RIP AND TEAR THROUGH THIS SYSTEM INSTALL)))\
--
That is all for now, get to work.
