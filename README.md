**VOID LINUX DREAM IS DEAD**\
**INSTALLATION IS FUEL**\
**GENTOO IS FULL**

## Things to install

Game plan: [Install gentoo](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Installation/About) under the following criteria:
* Uses [gentoobry overlay](https://github.com/gentoobr/overlay) for xanmod sources
* Replaces OpenRC with [66](https://framagit.org/gentoo-66/66tools-overlay/-/tree/master)
* Employs usage of btrfs subvolumes for snapshots

Install needed tools like doas, micro, ufw, whatever\
Install dbus, elogind, seatd or seat or whatever\
Reboot with those services enabled\
Install [wlgreet](https://git.sr.ht/~kennylevinsen/wlgreet)\
Prepare for GUI.

## Phase 2

Research use flags so you can consider the following:\
Install sway, all the shit that lets graphical applications work + kitty + firefox + wofi + shit\
verify sway works, then start syncing with this config\
(get pipewire working, then jamm)

___
That is all for now, get to work.
