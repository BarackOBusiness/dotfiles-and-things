    "OK",
    "SAME EXACT PROBLEM",

    "OK NOW NO GEAR WHEELS WHY DID YOU TAKE THAT MUFH",
    "ok its probably fine",
    "fucking I knew I shouldn't have done this design",
    "gimme a sec",
    "GENUS",
    "time to get taken into the science.,",
    "uhh we can make a solid fuel bus which has 12 MJ energy value and is probably more suited for machines anyway",
    "but idk if the energy cost is any less than coal, and we still need coal at the end of the day for doing shit with chemicals anyway",
    "lesgo 10 GJ per hour of solar panel production just got that achievement",
    "its a vast improvement",
    "just positioned wrongly",
    "bruhing",
    "its because the solid fuel production",
    "yeah, that's why we need circuit network signals to control production into other things",
    "yeah I just flushed the tank",
    "thats why things are working now",
    "oh I was about to say im gonna start a guilded call and you can join whenever you want but getting back works too",
    "here is the great deconstruction storage",
    "power usage down to a new low of 4.5 MW !",
    "we must replace everything",
    "we have produced enough electric furnaces",
    "they will take more space",
    "they were temporary endpoints to products that we needed a bunch of",
    "which we now have excess",
    "also the good thing about this is that our pollution is going to get eaten up in the meantime",
    "gaming belts",
    "also feed those old belts back into the red belt machines directly",
    "recycling.",
    "so what are your opinions on having mining separated from smelting, like we could have a modular mining base that directs over to a smelting facility that gets taken somewhere else to be put on a production bus or something",
    "yeah, probably what we're gonna have to do, since eventually resource patches will run out, and adding train stops to resource trains is a pretty easy task",
    "we could probably put smelting facility directly below us since there seems to be quite a bit of empty space",
    "or threat free rather",
    "ok I just like doubled the iron throughput into the red belt assembly by removing the bottlenecks in transport",
    "also we're probably not keeping that chemical facility so don't get too attached to it I'm probably too late to saying that",
    "theres 900 more",
    "there we go",
    "now this is beautiful",
    "brb gonna eat now",

    "there's too much possibility I have like absolutely no idea where to go from here",
    "I was working on prioritizing the oil train earlier because that's where refueling would have to happen, but it also could happen off site",
    "well we can just rid ourselves of boilers for now",
    "solar panels are more than enough, including what we have in chests",
    "uhh since we're in a no consumption period right now that would be the most optimal time to do it",
    "yeah sure",
    "I was planning on making a big resource income station here, bringing it up or down to smelters, then taking it back and feeding it into a main bus",
    "buss",
    "ok",
    "thinking about red...",
    "The iron shortage does provide a good thinking point though",
    "we need to design the trains so that it can accept multiple resource inputs",
    "going to disassemble this automation here and turn all of this into refueling station",
    "well yeah",
    "simple we just uhh don't need it right now",
    "alright now here's the deal, we crack heavy oil into light, and we crack petroleum into light, all of it goes to rocket fuel",
    "it's literally the recipe name but ok",
    "doing the calculating currently",
    "oh you can't crack petroleum gas to light oil",
    "I guess we'll just make solid fuel out of it",
    "no",
    "I guess it's more efficient to just directly make heavy into solid fuel too...",
    "I guess light will only be used in final process for rocket conversion",
    "3.75 temporary number storage",
    "alright...  to fully convert this all to rocket fuel, we'll need 62 assembling machine 2's, 31 chemical plants",
    "11 chem for petroleum, 5 for heavy, and 15 for light",
    "not permanent positions just laying out what I have",
    "annd that's all",
    "game",
    "nope",
    "there's no iron in any of the chests",
    "it would've showed there",
    "ok why not just mine the rest of the iron patch while we're at it so we have more excuse to move to the other one :tf:",
    "e",
    "uhh you wanna vc instead",
    "crazy",
    "ok apparently the oil yields are way down",
    "take a look",
    "everythings cut in half",
    "expected resources is half of what it used to be for every one of these jacks",
    "we only have about 26/s now, about what used to be one pumpjack",
    "so uhh well at least I can downscale this facility now",
    "great thinking head of business I've got.",
    "lemme do the actual defined math",
    "ok 46.9, a little more respectable than I thought, I think I missed the last big one",
    "and apparently it seems to be about the same production as before...... just 9 oil refineries allowed instead of 10?",
    "this has to be due to tick rate",
    "LMAO OK",
    "man everything turned on fast",
    "YEP",
